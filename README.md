This application aims to provide year-one primary school pupils with a fun, supplement learning activity; prompting a set of 14 multiple choice questions per game cycle. Upon start of each quiz session, 14 randomily chosen questions (2 per topic) are obtained via an SQLite question pool with over 50 questions.
